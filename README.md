## Running this code locally

We're going to be using a command-line interface. I'm writing this from the perspective of a Mac user using Terminal (zsh). If you're a Windows user, you might use Powershell. If you use Visual Studio Code, you might find [this page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-beginners-tutorial)
 helpful.
 
### 1. Clone or download this repo to your computer.
Once you've got it, [navigate to the directory](https://www.macworld.com/article/221277/command-line-navigating-files-folders-mac-terminal.html)
(ex: ``$ cd starter-code``)
### 2. [Make sure you have Node and npm installed.](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) 

Check to see if you can run  ``$ node -v`` and ``$ npm -v`` (My versions are v16.15.0 for node and 8.10.0 for npm.)
### 3. Install the Express module using npm. 
ex: ``$ npm install express``
### 4. Run the example app using Node:
ex: ``$ node App.js``

You should see the message ``Server is running on http://localhost:8000``

If you instead see an error message like ``Error: Cannot find module 'express'`` -- see step 3. 
### 5. View the website
Open a web browser (e.g. Google Chrome) to this URL: ``http://localhost:8000/``
